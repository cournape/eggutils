Set of utilities to manipulate and create eggs without setuptools, and outside
distutils context (i.e. without running setup).

Making an egg containing DLL
============================

Given Windows model for DLLs, when several python packages depends on the same
dll to be shared between extensions, it may be useful to have a "DLL egg" which
put the dlls within the python installation such as the dll are automatically
found by any extension to the corresponding python interpreter.

Usage:

::
        make-dll-egg -m PKG-INFO foo.dll bar.dll

This will create a DLL with metadata taken from the PKG-INFO file, containing
both foo and bar dlls.
